# Introduction
Thank you for applying to the lead embedded engineer role at Aerora.

If you're in this repo, you should have already completed the initial screening interview and been contacted by the hiring manager to schedule the US technical interview.

The interview process for this role is a follows:
1. Screening (completed)
2. US technical interview (current phase)
3. Global technical interview
4. Management/leadership interview

Please look at the interview guide, especially section 2, to determine when to schedule your interview so you give yourself time to complete the practical exercise.

For 2.3, we'd like candidates to limit the time they spend on the practical exercise to between 2 to 4 hours. If you find that you need to spend more than that, please reach out. We know job interviewing is busy and want to make the amount of time spend reasonable.

We will be conducting the interview via MS Teams and recording the interview so that our global interview team can review the interview in their timezone and prepare follow on questions for the global interview.

This interview is a work in progress, so if you have any recommendations or feedback, please let us know via LinkedIn.

1. Fork this repo to a private repo of your own and add [GhelAerora](https://github.com/GhelAerora)
2. Fill out Section 1 and 2 and commit to your repo by 11am US Pacific Time the morning of the interview

## 1.2. Most Qualifying Background
**What technical experience most qualifies you for this position? Please describe the associated technical aspects.**

## 1.3. Skill Gap Plan
**Based on the job description and what you understand the role to be, what is the most significant technical skill you are missing and how will you go about learning that skill?**

# Section 2. Technical
## 2.1. What are two things that you would change about Linux or Android?

## 2.2. Describe your preferred task, test, project, and source control management workflows.

## 2.3. Practical exercise
[QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) is an open source ground control station for drones ([Github](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol)).

A client wants to save video from the sensor to the drone's SD card in the air and also wants to stream the video to the Internet AND save it to the the Android ground control station itself.

**2.3.1. Identify the relevant components in QGroundControl that are involved in this use case and provide a high level sketch for presentation to the engineering team. You can use whatever formal or informal diagramming method you prefer. Link to the related artifact in your repository within this markdown file.**

**2.3.2. Is what the client asking possible with the existing code? Be prepared to talk us through how the features would work with the existing code or what changes would be needed.**

**2.3.3. Related to video processing, identify one function or object in the codebase that is poorly implemented, describe why, and show how you would fix it.**

**2.3.4. Related to video processing, identify one function or object in the codebase that is well implemented and describe why.**

**2.3.5. Identify one item within a commit that you don't think should have been approved by the reviewer but was still merged. Provide the feedback you would have given to the developer.**
